# Alex Sola personal webpage

Welcome! 

Here I am tracking the static code for my personal website. It is made for Hugo (https://gohugo.io) and hosted in an AWS S3 bucket with web features enabled. In this commits, I am not including the final html code in the public folder, the static folder (which has mainly images) and the theme folder of the Hugo project. 

The theme that I am using now is the **retroful** theme that can be found here: https://themes.gohugo.io/retrofulhugo/

Thanks for your visit.
