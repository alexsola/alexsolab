As the title suggests, follows the list of parts I really used for this project. Let’s get started (no special order):

**Pickups:** Seymour duncan JB Model Humbucker: lovely pickups, I would like to try others though, but these ones are really good (IMHO). One thing I really like of them is that they sound great and are passive. I had active ones in the Warlock, and honestly I don’t see much difference. So after using the active pickups, I am fan of the passive ones.

**Nut:** I really don’t have a reason for choosing this nut (as I said in my previous post). Also, after installing and using it, I still don’t get why I chose this one. But, I must admit it renders really nice once installed.

**Knobs:** These knobs are not the coolest ones, not very impressive also. But they do their job quite well for 2 main reasons: 1) They can be screwed to the potentiometer, so they are pretty steady. 2) the have a shape and form that make them nice to work with.

**Potentiometers:** To implement the split toning feature, I needed some “special” ones that can be pushed/pulled to (de)activate this mode. So in term of potentiometers, I have 2 varieties: regular ones (for the tones) and pull-ups (for the volume/split toning). The first to come are the pull-ups:

Of this second one, I received this one first and the second in a separate package in a different day… but I think one is enough to illustrate this.

Pickup selector: A regular, black, three-way pickups selector. You know: one position for one pickup, central position for both and third position for the other pickup. In my case, this positions are vertical and setting the bar in the bottom position I select the bridge pickup, centre is for both, and up is for the neck pickups.
